Taken in all the reasons
Never thought about a soul
Change of heart and ebbing seasons
I don't care, you have to know
Tarnished bands, lying pictures
Hall of fame is out of sight
Broken down, but barely hidden
I'll search for you when the grass is high
Stay out of sight
You will find
Places to hide
Stay out of sight
Can't close my eyes
Change the way heaven sees you
Play a part all your own
Hollow stares and hours fading
Apertures always close
Darkened skys, painted ceilings
Where all hope has taken flight
With my words that contain me
I'll be sure to hide where i lie
You were my hall of fame
