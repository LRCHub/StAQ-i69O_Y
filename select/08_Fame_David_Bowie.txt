Fame (fame) makes a man take things over
Fame (fame) lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame (fame) puts you there where things are hollow
Fame (fame)
Fame, not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you insane (sane)
Fame (fame)
Fame (fame), what you like is in the limo
Fame (fame), what you get is no tomorrow
Fame (fame), what you need you have to borrow
Fame (fame)
Fame, "Nein, it's mine", is just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to crime (crime)
Fame (fame)
Could it be the best, could it be?
Really be, really, babe?
Could it be, my babe, could it, babe?
Could it, babe? Could it, babe?
Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Is it any wonder you're all too cool to fool?
Fame (fame)
Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Gotta get a rain check on fame (fame)
Fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, what's your name?
